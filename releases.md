# Releases

## v0.2.0

  - Added `exactly(count)` method to `Sus::Fixtures::Benchmark::Repeats` which returns an `Exactly` instance for fixed-count benchmarking.

## v0.1.0

  - Added `Sus::Fixtures::Benchmark::Repeats` which is not an integer, but an instance that allows the block to be executed multiple times until the benchmark converges.
